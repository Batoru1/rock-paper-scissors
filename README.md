Game rock paper scissors

Finally finished rps with the help of otp, mdn W3schools, stackoverflow and some light youtubing...
I'm finally begining to get js.
While coding rps I learned about Math.floor, Math.random, .lenght, template literals, .slice, .toUpper(lower)case, increments, decrements, think I need to get better with loops.
Quite happy about this

2023-03-03 Had a long brake, js was to hard for me, luckily found CodingAddict on Youtube and will try to REVISIT RPS from the DOM now.
