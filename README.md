Game rock paper scissors

Finally finished rps with the help of otp, mdn W3schools, stackoverflow and some light youtubing...
I'm finally begining to get js.
While coding rps I learned about Math.floor, Math.random, .lenght, template literals, .slice, .toUpper(lower)case, increments, decrements, think I need to get better with loops.
Quite happy about this

2023-03-03 Had a long brake, js was to hard for me, luckily found CodingAddict on Youtube and will try to REVISIT RPS from the DOM now.

Some comments that won't let me see code clearly:
/_template literal's tag function(it could be ${computerSelection} as well + first letter always to upper case using .slice_/ ~21

Displayed winner of game, but count keeps getting above 5?need fix, as well as declare running score

Declared running score

Count and running score need not be infinite!!!
Count and running score need to disappear after each declaration!!!
