Game rock paper scissors

Finally finished  rps wirh the help of otp, mdn W3schools, stackoverflow and some lig youtubing...
I'm finally begining to get js.
While coding rps I learned about Math.floor, Math.random, .lenght, template literals, .slice, .toUpper(lower)case, increments, decrements, though I need to get better wit loops.
Quite happy about this
